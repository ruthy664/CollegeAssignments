These are 2 projects from my Programming Languages class. One of them is a simple 
interpreter for a simple language implemented in python. The grammar for this language is provided in grammar.txt. 
I created all the code for this assignment.

The second project is a simple interpreter for this language implemented with emacs designed to 
interpret the grammar provided in grammar.txt. For this assignment, 
the professor provided incomplete code that we had to finish.
